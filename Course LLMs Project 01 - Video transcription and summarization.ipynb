three main points the first one is that there are a lot of neurons for example one here one here another here and so on all these bright points are neurons there is scientific research that indicates that the human brain has more than 100 billions neurons it is a very large amount amount the second main point is that all these neurons are interconnected as you can see in this picture for example this neuron is connected with this one this other new room here is connected with this one and so on finally the third and last point is that information flows from one neuron to another neuron using these connections as you can see the lines connecting them this flow of information is responsible for our human abilities such as walking seeing speaking running having new ideas and so on let's suppose you speak Spanish but you don't speak English that means your brain has the connections to speak Spanish from the moment you start learning English your brain will start to create new connections among the neurons with this new information you have acquired about this new language we can consider that new skills leads to new connections finally based on this image we can conclude that the neural network is composed by a set of interconnected neurons that exchange information now that you have already learned this basic idea we will look at the neuron and analyze its components you can see in this image the neural representation and we are going to analyze four main components which are the dendrites the cell body the axon and the axon terminals to understand these components let's analyze only one neuron first then we can add more and more neurons to build a complete neural network very similar to the one you have seen in this first image now I will summarize in a single sentence the function of each one of these components the dendrites receive data from other neurons as you can see here the cell body processes this data and finally the action transmits signals to other neurons using the axon terminals in other words the whole neuron is used by the brain to process information so I can also call a new room as an information Processing Unit there is another very important word which is synapse and it means the transmission of information in neurons the information is electrical signals that flows from one neuron to another when a neuron transmits information or electrical signal house this process is starting at the didn't rights and ending at the terminals we say that it has made a synapse when assignapse occurs chemical substances are released by The neurons and these chemical substances enter the band rights increasing or decreasing the electrical potential of the cell body so the information processing in a biological neuron is given by the electrical potential which will then lead to decision making going back to the example of learning the English language the new connections formed in the brain are based precisely on this

E começa a cruzar a rua.  Enquanto isso, um banqueiro estreia \n","seu novo automóvel sem saber que tem   um pequeno problema nos freios.\n","Dirigindo em alta velocidade,   ele mal consegue desviar de uma carruagem.\n","Nosso homem, cruzando a rua distraído,   não vê o carro chegar.\n","Ele é atropelado e morre.  Mas este homem era nada mais nada \n","menos do que Albert Einstein.  Naquele ano, Einstein teria \n","publicado quatro trabalhos   que se tornariam a base da física moderna.\n","Mas agora, inovações como o GPS, as telas   de TV e os semicondutores que nos permitiram \n","criar os computadores portáteis nunca ocorrem.  O computador, o laptop ou o celular em que você   está assistindo esse vídeo nunca chegam a \n","existir. E este vídeo… também não existe.  Esta sequência de eventos é um exemplo \n","do que se conhece como efeito borboleta,   uma manifestação da Teoria do Caos.\n","Durante muitos séculos, o mundo   foi explicado através das leis de \n","Isaac Newton e da física clássica.  De acordo com estas leis, se conhecemos o estado \n","atual de um objeto, podemos prever com relativa   facilidade seu comportamento no futuro.\n","A Teoria do Caos questiona essa visão   determinista: nem tudo é previsível, \n","nem funciona como um relógio.  Desde os anos 1800, matemáticos propunham \n","a ideia de que nem todos os fenômenos   podiam ser previstos pelas leis newtonianas.\n","Mas foi um meteorologista chamado Edward Lorenz   que fez da teoria do caos um fenômeno visível.\n","Tudo começou em 1961, quando ele trabalhava em um   modelo matemático para prever o estado do tempo.\n","Lorenz estava colocando em seu computador dados   como temperatura, umidade, pressão \n","atmosférica e direção do vento.  E o computador desenhava um gráfico modelando como \n","seria o comportamento do tempo - ele não acertava   sempre, mas se aproximava bastante da realidade.\n","Em uma manhã, Lorenz decidiu verificar   alguns resultados. Pausou o modelo no \n","computador e, para economizar tempo,   fez os cálculos ele mesmo. Ligou de novo o \n","modo automático e saiu para tomar um café.  Quando ele voltou, o gráfico resultado era muito \n","diferente do original. Começava bem parecido,   mas, já na metade, tinha uma \n","trajetória bastante divergente.  Surpreendido, ele revisou os números. E percebeu \n","que o número que ele havia colocado a mão tinha   três casas decimais a menos do que o que \n","o computador estava utilizando antes.  Essa diferença, que alterou tanto \n","a trajetória do gráfico, equivale a   uma partícula de pó sobre a Torre Eiffel, \n","ou a uma pena a menos no peso de um pato.  Lorenz deduziu que esse experimento não era \n","um caso especial - que havia sistemas nos   quais diferenças mínimas produziam, \n","com o tempo, mudanças monumentais,   fazendo com que seu futuro seja imprevisível.\n","Isso quer dizer que o bater de asas de uma   borboleta no Brasil poderia, em teoria, produzir \n","uma perturbação suficiente, um certo “caos”, que   acabasse provocando um furacão no Texas.\n","Ou seja, por mais que nós conheçamos as   leis da natureza, não há medições que \n","nos deem dados perfeitos e nos permitam   determinar a posição e a velocidade de cada \n","um dos átomos do universo a cada momento.  E esta “falta de exatidão” em nossos cálculos \n","dificulta quaisquer previsões – e, na verdade,   torna impossível prever algo a longo prazo.\n","Só que caos não é o mesmo que falta de ordem.  Mesmo que o caos dificulte as previsões, \n","o universo em que vivemos não é aleatório   e continua obedecendo as leis naturais.\n","Além disso, por mais caótico que pareça,   um sistema sempre segue uma \n","trajetória até determinados pontos.  Lorenz comprovou isso ao perceber que, nos \n","cálculos que usou em seu modelo, a trajetória   repetida até os mesmos pontos criou um padrão que \n","parecia justamente com as asas de uma borboleta.  Entender os padrões dentro do caos \n","tem muitas aplicações práticas.  Na Bolsa de Valores, nos mostra que \n","uma ligeira flutuação pode causar uma   crise no mercado – e que por isso não podemos \n","falar de previsões, apenas de probabilidades.  No caso do corpo humano, nos ajuda \n","a compreender o comportamento de um   coração com arritmia cardíaca.\n","E até no comportamento humano,   o efeito mariposa nos ajuda a analisar \n","fenômenos sociais – por exemplo,   como a trollagem nas redes sociais pode ser \n","desencadeada por apenas um comentário negativo.  Nosso universo continua obedecendo as \n","leis de causa e efeito. O sol continuará   saindo a cada manhã. Os aviões que \n","construímos continuarão voando.  ​​No fim das contas, a teoria do caos introduz   um elemento de incerteza na \n","nossa leitura do Universo.  E coloca em xeque os limites \n","do nosso conhecimento.

According to these laws, if we know the\n","current state of an object, we can relatively easily predict its behavior in the future.\n","Chaos Theory questions this deterministic view: not everything is predictable,\n","nor does it work like clockwork. Since the 1800s, mathematicians proposed\n","the idea that not all phenomena could be predicted by Newtonian laws.\n","But it was a meteorologist named Edward Lorenz who made chaos theory a visible phenomenon.  It\n","all started in 1961, when he was working on a mathematical model to predict the weather.\n","Lorenz was entering data into his computer such as temperature, humidity,\n","atmospheric pressure and wind direction. And the computer drew a graph modeling how\n","the weather would behave - it didn't always get it right , but it was very close to reality.\n","One morning, Lorenz decided to check some results.  He paused the model on the\n","computer and, to save time, he did the calculations himself.  He turned the\n","automatic mode back on and went out for a coffee. When he came back, the resulting graph was very\n","different from the original.  It started very similar, but, halfway through, it had a\n","very divergent trajectory. Surprised, he reviewed the numbers.  And he realized\n","that the number he had entered had three decimal places less than what\n","the computer was using before. This difference, which altered\n","the trajectory of the graph so much, is equivalent to a speck of dust on the Eiffel Tower,\n","or one feather less in the weight of a duck. Lorenz deduced that this experiment was not\n","a special case - that there were systems in which minute differences produced,\n","over time, monumental changes, making their future unpredictable.\n","This means that the flapping of the wings of a butterfly in Brazil could, in theory, produce\n","enough disturbance, a certain “chaos”, that would end up causing a hurricane in Texas.\n","In other words, as much as we know the laws of nature, there are no measurements that\n","give us perfect data and allow us to determine the position and speed of\n","each of the atoms in the universe at every moment. And this “lack of accuracy” in our calculations\n","makes any predictions difficult – and, in fact, makes it impossible to predict anything in the long term.\n","But chaos is not the same as a lack of order. Even though chaos makes predictions difficult,\n","the universe we live in is not random and continues to obey natural laws.\n","Furthermore, no matter how chaotic it may seem, a system always follows a\n","trajectory to certain points. Lorenz proved this when he realized that, in the\n","calculations he used in his model, the repeated trajectory to the same points created a pattern that\n","looked exactly like the wings of a butterfly. Understanding patterns within chaos\n","has many practical applications. On the Stock Exchange, it shows us that\n","a slight fluctuation can cause a market crisis – and that is why we cannot\n","talk about predictions, only probabilities. In the case of the human body, it helps us\n","to understand the behavior of a heart with cardiac arrhythmia.\n","And even in human behavior, the butterfly effect helps us analyze\n","social phenomena – for example, how trolling on social media can be\n","triggered by just one negative comment. Our universe continues to obey the\n","laws of cause and effect.  The sun will continue to come out each morning.  The planes we\n","built will continue to fly. Ultimately, chaos theory introduces an element of uncertainty into\n","our reading of the Universe. And it calls into question the limits\n","of our knowledge.

welcome to this lecture where you are going to learn about the biological fundamentals of human neural networks it is important that you have a basic understanding of this subject because an artificial neural network is related to the way a human neural network works this image is an example of a human neural network and we are going to discuss three main points the first one is that there are a lot of neurons for example one here one here another here and so on all these bright points are neurons there is scientific research that indicates that the human brain has more than 100 billions neurons it is a very large amount amount the second main point is that all these neurons are interconnected as you can see in this picture for example this neuron is connected with this one this other new room here is connected with this one and so on finally the third and last point is that information flows from one neuron to another neuron using these connections as you can see the lines connecting them this flow of information is responsible for our human abilities such as walking seeing speaking running having new ideas and so on let's suppose you speak Spanish but you don't speak English that means your brain has the connections to speak Spanish from the moment you start learning English your brain will start to create new connections among the neurons with this new information you have acquired about this new language we can consider that new skills leads to new connections finally based on this image we can conclude that the neural network is composed by a set of interconnected neurons that exchange information now that you have already learned this basic idea we will look at the neuron and analyze its components you can see in this image the neural representation and we are going to analyze four main components which are the dendrites the cell body the axon and the axon terminals to understand these components let's analyze only one neuron first then we can add more and more neurons to build a complete neural network very similar to the one you have seen in this first image now I will summarize in a single sentence the function of each one of these components the dendrites receive data from other neurons as you can see here the cell body processes this data and finally the action transmits signals to other neurons using the axon terminals in other words the whole neuron is used by the brain to process information so I can also call a new room as an information Processing Unit there is another very important word which is synapse and it means the transmission of information in neurons the information is electrical signals that flows from one neuron to another when a neuron transmits information or electrical signal house this process is starting at the didn't rights and ending at the terminals we say that it has made a synapse when assignapse occurs chemical substances are released by The neurons and these chemical substances enter the band rights increasing or decreasing the electrical potential of the cell body so the information processing in a biological neuron is given by the electrical potential which will then lead to decision making going back to the example of learning the English language the new connections formed in the brain are based precisely on this electrical potential in the next lecture you are going to understand stands how the artificial neural Works see you

Like, you might drop a stone in a pond and it makes ripples, and then those ripples might make other ripples, and so on. That's kind of like what the \"butterfly effect\" is.\n\nIt's a big idea that says that even tiny things, like a butterfly flapping its wings, can cause big changes later on. It's like a big chain reaction!\n\nImagine you're playing with a ball on a trampoline. You throw the ball, and it bounces up and down. But if you throw it just a little bit harder or softer, it might bounce in a different way. That's kind of like what the butterfly effect is. It's like the ball is bouncing around and making different patterns, and we can't always predict where it will go.\n\nBut here's the thing: even though we can't predict everything, the world still follows rules. Like, the sun will still rise and set, and birds will still fly south for the winter. It's just that sometimes, tiny things can make big differences.\n\nSo, the butterfly effect is like a reminder that the world is a big, complicated place, and we can't always control everything. But it's also kind of cool, because it means that even tiny things we do can make a big difference!\n\nI hope that makes sense!
