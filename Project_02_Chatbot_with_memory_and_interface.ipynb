This will give it a better understanding of the message context based on past interactions (chatbots with this capability are known as \"Context-Aware Chatbots\"). Additionally, we will explore how to easily create a user-friendly interface (UI) for your application using a versatile library called Streamlit.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "* You can already run it locally as shown in the lesson, but if you're encountering configuration errors in your local environment, we recommend using Colab first to avoid disrupting the learning flow. However, if you choose to do it locally right away, that's also very possible and actually it is the ideal, as Streamlit requires working with .py files, while in Colab we use .ipynb due to Jupyter Notebook. Therefore, you will need to combine everything into a single .py file.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Additionally, when running locally, you can see changes more quickly. After executing the command to initialize Streamlit (e.g., `!streamlit run proj02.py`), you just need to edit and save the .py script, then refresh the Streamlit page to see the updates. In other words, you don’t need to re-run the `!streamlit`... command.\n",

So the %%writefile command allows the notebook cell to be saved as an external file.\n",

This makes it easier to run the application because Streamlit can load and execute all of the code at once, without having to deal with multiple cells or scattered files. It is a convenient way to consolidate the code so that Streamlit works properly in the Colab environment.\n",
