Below we will list the strategies that can be applied to optimize the quality of the responses and the efficiency of the system:\n","\n","* Test other Embedding models - as mentioned, selecting the correct model for the RAG system is crucial, as it directly affects the accuracy of the responses, in addition to the use of resources and the scalability of the application. Choosing models that work well with the language and the task in question can significantly improve the results. By testing different models, you can identify which one offers the best combination of quality and efficiency for your needs.\n","\n","* Adjust the fixed (system) prompt - Modifying the system prompt to make it more explicit about the functions that the LLM should perform can improve the results. The prompt should clearly specify what the LLM should prioritize in the response and what should be ignored. This guides the model to focus on what is most relevant to your application and your goal.\n","\n","* Improve the user prompt - remind the user (perhaps by placing a warning in the interface) that the more specific the question is, the greater the chance of increasing the accuracy of the answers generated by LLM. The more detailed and clear the request, the more relevant the return will be. This practice also helps to reduce ambiguities that can harm the model's interpretation of the query.\n","\n","* Adjust the contextualization prompt - remember that this prompt reformulates the user's question based on the conversation history, something useful when the query needs context to be correctly interpreted. The contextualization prompt (context_q_system_prompt) instructs the model to take the history into account.\n","\n","* Test other LLMs - Exploring other language models, especially those that accept a larger number of tokens and perform well in the chosen language, can improve performance. For more demanding cases, it may be worth considering proprietary solutions such as ChatGPT or paid services (such as Groq, mentioned in Colab 1) that provide large open-source models. Larger models can better handle complex queries and provide more elaborate responses.\n","\n","* Adjust the retrieval parameters (k and fetch_k) - Modifying the parameters of the retrieval steps, such as the values ​​of k and fetch_k, can have a significant impact on the performance of your application. Try starting with smaller values ​​and increasing them as necessary, always monitoring the impact on the relevance and quality of the responses. For more details, see the section on the RAG pipeline and the retriever. Another idea would be to test other algorithms besides MMR.\n","\n","* Make it better prepared to accept any document - one idea is to preprocess PDF files (or other formats) to adapt them to the vector store. PDFs often have tables or other structures that make interpretation difficult; or documents in different formats such as HTML, CSV, or PPTX are not structured for optimal information extraction. Preparing these files is crucial to ensure that relevant content is correctly captured and made available to the retrieval system.\n","* There are specialized solutions that automate this transformation, organizing the data and eliminating unnecessary information. This optimizes the workflow and improves the accuracy of the results. One example is the Unstructured service (Visit https://unstructured.io), which facilitates the extraction of complex data from files, making them ready for use in vector databases and LLM frameworks, which increases the quality of information retrieval and the performance of the RAG application.\n","* To use this in langchain is simple, you can use the Document Loader method. In practice, just load the document using the Unstructured document loader (instead of the PyPDFLoader that we used). More details here: https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/document_loaders/unstructured_file/\n","\n","These strategies aim to optimize the efficiency and quality of the RAG system's responses, adapting it to your specific use case."],"metadata":{"id":"Ex1IJrK34UCw"}}]}
